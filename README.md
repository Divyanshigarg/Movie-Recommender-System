# Movie-Recommender-System
It's a Python based Movie Recommendation System, which recommends movies to the users based on the similarity to previously watched movies.

## Objective of the project

For e.g., Netflix recommends movies to watch based on your previous movies that you have watched in the past.  
To demonstrate the working of Item-based collaborative filtering by recommending elements based on relationship between items and not people. 
 
The results will be provided using a series of actions i.e., using a large dataset which contains the ratings or reviews of each movie. Furthermore, performing item based collaborative movie filtering on one movie sample and performing it for the entire dataset.
